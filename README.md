Tools for working with the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) in Python

TODO: Create a test runner that spits out TAP (TAP producer in the vernacular). Have options for either 1 big TAP file or 1 file per test case.
TODO: Create an API similar to Test::Harness (if it makes sense to do so) to provide programmatic access to TAP results within Python programs.
TODO: Create an executable `tappy` which should function like `prove`.
