tappy
=====

Tools for working with the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) in Python

*   TODO: Have options for either 1 big TAP file or 1 file per test case.
*   TODO: Create an API similar to Test::Harness (if it makes sense to do so) to provide programmatic access to TAP results within Python programs.
*   TODO: Create an executable `tappy` which should function like `prove`.
*   TODO: Use travis to do an end to end test. Run the test suite to generate
    TAP and use `tappy` to parse and verify the results. The results should
    always be the same.
*   TODO: provide Sphinx documentation at read the docs.
