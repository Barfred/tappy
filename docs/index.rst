tappy - TAP tools for Python
============================

**tappy** provides tools for working with the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) in
Python. **tappy** generates TAP output for your ``unittest`` test cases. You
can use the TAP output files with a tool like the `Jenkins TAP plugin
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin>`_ or any other TAP
consumer.

For the curious: **tappy** sounds like "happy."
